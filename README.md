## Solidity Security Learning Repository

This repository contains my notes, experiments and intentionally vulnerable example contracts used to learn and demonstrate common Solidity security issues.

## About

This repo documents my personal journey in learning and exploring Solidity security vulnerabilities.
It includes practice contracts, PoC exploits, mitigation notes, and small scripts used to reproduce or test problems in a safe environment.

## Important Notice

The code in this repository is for educational purposes only.
Many examples are intentionally insecure to illustrate vulnerabilities — do not deploy them on mainnet or use them in production.

By using any code from this repository you acknowledge the risks and agree to use it only in controlled, local or testnet environments.
